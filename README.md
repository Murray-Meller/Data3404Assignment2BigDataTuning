# Data3404Assignment2BigDataTuning

Hey Kevin:

Here is what i have done so far:
1. Created this repository.
2. Loaded in all the needed Flink libraries. Configured the build path to use them. I'm not sure if this will copy across to your computer. Hopefully it will, but if it doesn't, all the .jar files are in the source folder so you can add them in yourself.
3. Copied across the week 10 tutorial file into our java file. Hopefully we can use this as a template.

Having read the assignment, it seems like we need to write 3 apache flink queries. My gut says that the easiest way for us to pull this off is to make a new class for each task?
